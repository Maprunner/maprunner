My first orienteering event was in November 1977 whilst I was still at school, and since then I have averaged well over one event a week (2397 events and counting as at June 2017).

I represented Great Britain at junior level, but could never run fast enough to make it to the top. Competitively my best results have been being [British Night Champion at M45](/british-night-champion-2009-mytchett/) in 2009, winning the [Harvester Trophy Relay](/of-night-and-light-and-the-half-light/) in 1986 with LOK, and being M40 British Relay Champion in 2005 with HH. I have also held several somewhat less prestigious titles including being Mallorcan Champion in 2004 and Queensland M40 Champion in 2005. I have travelled all over the world to orienteer, including trips to [Russia](/moscow-ringworld-1994/), [China](/china-3-day-event-1995-guangzhou/), Hong Kong, [Australia](/orienteering-on-the-woolwich-ferry/), New Zealand, [Canada](/canadian-orienteering-championships-1996/), the [USA](/world-orienteering-championships-93/), Swaziland, South Africa, Iceland and most of Europe.

I am an active planner and controller, and controlled the two sprint races at Round 1 of the [2005 World Cup](/controlling-the-world-cup-sprint-races/) in Guildford in 2005, the British Sprint Championships in 2006, 2008 and 2013 and the JK Sprint Race in 2007. Spot a pattern? I was Chairman of BOF Technical Committee from 1997 to 2003, during which time I was responsible for a complete rewrite of the BOF Rules and Guidelines, and I was the IOF Senior Event Adviser for the Junior World Orienteering Championships in Italy in 2009. I have also been Chairman of LOK (twice) and the South Eastern Orienteering Association. I have produced a large number of maps of schools, Guide Centres and even some real woodland. My largest map to date was for the [2013 St Albans City Race](http://www.happyherts.routegadget.co.uk/rg2/#122), for which I was also the planner. This won the Walsh Trophy for the best urban or sprint map in 2013.

I am also the developer and maintainer of [Routegadget 2](https://github.com/Maprunner/rg2), a web-based application for drawing and comparing orienteering routes. This is used by over [100 clubs worldwide](http://www.maprunner.co.uk/rg2-stats/sites).

In my spare time I am an independent engineering consultant specialising in safety engineering for computer-based railway control systems with a focus on ERTMS (European Railway Traffic Management System). To maintain the orienteering connection, my company is called [Surebridge](http://www.surebridge.co.uk).
