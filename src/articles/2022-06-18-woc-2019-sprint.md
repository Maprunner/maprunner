Well that surprised a few people. WOC 2019 was in Norway but it was the first of the new "forest" WOCs so there weren't any sprint races. The sprinters sat at home and waited for 2020 and the first "sprint "WOC to be held in Denmark. It was to be a long wait. Little did they or we know what was about to happen.
