**LOK STARS 1-2 in WORLD CORPORATE GAMES.
REST OF WORLD NOWHERE!!!!!!!!**

LOK's Simon Bourne and Mark Chapman recorded a spectacular first and second place in the World Corporate Games at Addington Hills on Saturday.

Running in the open class in appalling weather conditions, Simon, in the colours of employer Arthur Andersen, scorched round the 5.6km course in 33.19. Hot on his heels was club colleague and friendly rival Mark from British Gas, who was only 56 seconds slower. Third place was out of sight, a massive 45 minutes behind!

Mark clearly knows how to step on the gas! And Simon won't be needing the AA next time he's out driving! In a joint statement, Simon and Mark said: 'We did it for Britain and LOK!'

From an article by Greg Birdseye in Lokation, the LOK newsletter.

(LOK organised the orienteering at the World Corporate Games 1992. Addington is a 1:7500 map of 1 square kilometre of part of Croydon, South London. Greg was Chairman at the time, and so was of course known as Captain Birdseye. This is hilarious if you know what fish fingers are, but I'm not sure if it will make sense anywhere outside of Great Britain.)
