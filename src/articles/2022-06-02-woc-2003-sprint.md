By 2003 we had worked out what Sprint was, and Jamie Stevenson had worked out how to do it. Britain's second WOC gold medal came around the streets of Rapperswill with a final sprint inside an ice rink. Thierry started his WOC medal haul with a bronze. I sat at home and listened to coverage on the internet.

Later that week Jamie took bronze with Jon Duncan and Dan Marston in the relay. 2003 remains the last WOC where GB managed two medals.
