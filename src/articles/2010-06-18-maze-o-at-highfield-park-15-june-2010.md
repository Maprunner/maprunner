Helen tried out the the new Maze-O event at the <a href="https://www.herts-orienteering.club/">HH</a> Evening Event on 15th June. We now know that two of us can put out all the stakes and tape for the full maze in about an hour.

We also know that it can keep a group of people ranging from experienced senior orienteers to complete novices who happened to be in the park that night occupied for quite a long time.
