The Sprint Final proved an uphill struggle for most but two strong results had the British Team in good spirits.

## GB News
The GB team put the loss of Kris Jones behind them as they produced two top 15 finishes with Peter Hodkinson and Chris Smithard coming 13th and 14th respectively, just 0.7 seconds apart. You can read our report all about the day, including some words from World Championships first timer Megan Carter-Davies [here](https://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/news/3794).

## WOC News
Perhaps the biggest news of the day was World Cup 2017 Round 1 winner and hot favourite Yannick Michiels putting in a performance to forget with his 34th place finish; 0:20 down on eventual winner Daniel Hubmann by the first control, scrappy routechoices left him 0:45 down at the arena passage and 1:27 behind at the end.

I'm sure it's just a coincidence, but I'd like to mention that Belgium and Yannick was [Simon's tip](https://maprunner.blogspot.com.uk/2017/06/gallia-est-omnis-divisa-in-tres-partes.html) for a new country medalling at WOC 2017, and the sadly injured Kris was his tip for a GB medal. Take that as you will.

## Things You Might Have Missed
I've already mentioned just how close Chris and Peter were at the end today, but did you know it was all on the run-in? Together at the last control, Peter just managed to outsprint his fellow GB team mate - and speaking to the pair of them after the race, Chris reckoned Peter's slick new resistance-reducing haircut might have been the difference. I'd take it Peter - I mean you need some way of explaining that particular root-choice.
