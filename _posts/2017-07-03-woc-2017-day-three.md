Here's my summary of an up and down day (in more ways than one!) at the WOC 2017 Sprint Relay.

## GB News
The GB Team were so near yet so far from a medal, with a Kris Jones mistake on the third lap costing the team a chance of a top three position. Cat Taylor put in a very strong race on first lap to keep the team up with the leading pack, finishing 6th and within touching distance of the leaders Switzerland. 

Ralph then had an excellent run, moving his team up into 2nd position despite having the longer gaffle in the castle and sending Kris out hot on the tail of Martin Hubmann. Kris started powerfully, taking the lead by control 3 and holding it through the arena passage and out onto the 2nd castle loop. 

However, knowing that this race was always going to be tight with lots of very strong teams, he pushed on as hard as he could and unfortunately came unstuck in the very tricky wooded area at the south of the map, with him and Hubmann losing nearly 2 minutes. Coming in to the final changeover in 6th position, Tessa did her best to catch up but couldn't quite manage it, holding onto 6th at the finish.

## Things You May Have Missed
The slope down from the castle into the wood between controls 13 and 14 on the Men's course - the one Ralph is pictured deciding to avoid, whilst the Austrian Matthais Reiner goes straight down (and back up later!) - was deemed so unsafe by the event team that they posted a first aider at the top in case of injury; though as Simon pointed out, perhaps they would have been better placed at the bottom!
