Two months ago Helen decided to organise a <a href="http://www.fleetvillejm.herts.sch.uk/">Fleetville Junior School</a> team for the <a href="http://www.cix.co.uk/~neper/bsoc08/" >British Schools Orienteering Championships</a>. Since then they have been to events in places like Epping Forest, Verulamium, Rothamsted and High Wycombe, as well as having a coaching day in Highfield Park during half term.

Yesterday the team of 16 put in a fantastic performance and came away with three medals: third school in Girls Year 5, second school in Boys Year 6, and third place in the overall Primary Schools competition.
