So, just one day left until the start of the 34th World Orienteering Championships in Tartu, Estonia. This will be my 5th WOC as a spectator, having previously been to two in Scotland (1999 and 2015), 2006 in Denmark, and 2007 in Ukraine, but it's Simon's 12th and you can find out all about his experience as a WOC addict from the articles on this site and from [his blog](https://maprunner.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/WOC) - here's some to start you off:
* [WOC 76](https://maprunner.blogspot.co.uk/2006/07/woc-15-how-it-all-started.html) - where it all began
* [WOC 93](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/woc-1993-classic-race/) - a unique view of the 1993 Classic Race
* [WOC 99](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/the-agony-of-the-long-distance-world-championships-spectator/) - Team GB's first WOC gold

You can also play about with the [Maprunner WOC/JWOC database](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/wocdb/) - give it a look and see what you can discover

## WOC 2017

Anyway, back to the here and now: Estonia, 30th June - 7th July. It's going to be a busy week for me and Simon, what with the spectating, running our own races in the Estonian O-Week, and providing coverage of the week's events for Maprunner and British Orienteering, but we're both looking forward to getting out there and experiencing a new country (for the both of us!).

Make sure you are familiar with the [GB Team](/woc2017/gb-team) and have a read through [their blog](http://gbteamwoc2017.blogspot.co.uk/) to find out about their preparation for the main event.

Simon's currently writing a post about what you might expect to see from WOC 2017, so here's what you can expect to see from us:
* Daily reports on the GB Team after each race on the [BOF website](https://www.britishorienteering.org.uk/)
* Articles about the GB Team and WOC in general for [Maprunner](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/woc2017/articles/)
* Posts from Simon over on [his blog](https://maprunner.blogspot.co.uk/)
* Live updates on the British Orienteering [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GBRorienteering) and Maprunner [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Maprunner.co.uk/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaprunnerGB)
